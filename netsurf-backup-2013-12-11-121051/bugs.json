The result is that if you open a few \nwindows and close them, the toolbars are still hanging \naround the system taking up resources \\(for the Wimp\\).\n",

Since I have been using this 9 Jul 2007 version regularly for months, I deleted all copies of Netsurf from the machine in use and, over my local net tried the copy on one of my other machines - this crashed too\\!\r\n\r\nRunning that copy on its own machine, however, ran perfectly - as I expected.\r\n\r\nI copied this to the machine causing the problem - still segfaulting.\r\n\r\nI rebooted and the 9 Jul version works seetly again.\r\n\r\nI suspect that something rogue had happened due to previous activity using some other application/utility over the last few weeks since the last boot, however, as when I tried to shut down prior to reboot there were fatal errors in Minidisc, StrongED, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, it appears that the error may not actually be in Netsurf, I sort of suspect that there is something which it isn't or can't catch and recover from. Hence this bug report.\r\n\r\nI wish I could offer more thoughts as this is the sort of bug that leaves me tearing my hair out\\!\\!\r\n\r\nKeith Hopper\r\nasgard@inspire.net.nz",

  "description": "Simple form with &lt;select&gt;&lt;option value=\"...\"&gt;Option text&lt;/option&gt;....\r\nwhere some option text might be fairly long \\(say 40 characters\\) typically causes the displayed element to be too narrow to contain the selected option. The result is truncation of the selected option text.\r\n\r\nThis was seen with default font face and size \\(homerton\\) with NS 1.1 \\(15 Oct 2007 23:00 r3633\\).\r\nmike.hobbs@antplc.com or mike@mhobbs.demon.co.uk\r\n\r\nAnd while I'm entering this bug report I've noticed another input element size problem. The Summary input is showing the summary text of this bug where the caret will not move to the beginning of the text. It shows \"lect menu size too small to contain all option tex\" and the caret won't go any further left than between the truncated \"e\" and the \"l\". It does move to the end of the text. Further experimenting reveals that this condition is dependent on placing the caret within the text usint the mouse and then moving it left with cursor key. If the caret is moved to the end of the text and then left it will go all the way to the beginning.\r\nLooks like there is a wrong calculation of the size of the rendered text under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnd, if the desktop is using system font the NS version details don't fit in the Version field of the Info window.\r\n",

  "description": "Hello Netsurf Developers,\n\nSince half October 2004 or so, ALL newer releases \ncrash sooner or later while accessing the Drobe site \n\\(www.drobe.co.uk\\) on my RiscPC at work\nand also on my Omega at home. What happens is that \nwhile loading some page on Drobe, Netsurf just \ndisappears completely \\(windows and iconbar icon\\). No \nerror message. There is no fixed reproducable pattern\nbefore the error arises, but it always happens sooner \nor later \\(mostly sooner\\!\\). Most other sites are OK. \nWith every new release I was hoping that the problem \nwas solved, because I could not think I was the\nonly one having this problem. Today \\(07-12-04\\) I \ndownloaded the latest release again, but the problem \nis still there :-\\(\n\nI have attached a fresh copy of the stderr file \nproduced after accessing the Drobe site anew. I \nnoticed a Floating point exception message in the\nerror report.\n\nBest regards.\nFrits Polak\n\ne-mail: fritspolak@hetnet.nl\n",

The main page \r\nstarts to build up initially, but when almost doen , \r\nNetsurf crashes. If I interrupt the loading of the home \r\npage of Drobe, Netsurf doesn't crash yet, but on trying a \r\nsubpage, 9 out of 10 times it crashes after all. I tried to \r\nask about this lately on the netsurf mailing list \r\n\\(netsurf-develop@lists.sourgeforge.net\\), but my mails keep \r\non bouncing.\r\n\r\nHopefully this problem can be solved soon, because Drobe \r\nis an essential news site for RISC OS users like me and \r\nthis makes Netsurf almost unusable for me.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFrits",

Until I've read up more on the issue, I'm going to let the current behaviour  stand.\r\nWhilst we're dealing with linebreaks, NetSurf fails to differentiate between CR, LF and CRLF sequences in text areas - they all get submitted as CRLF sequences.

However, this isn't particularly efficient, as a great deal of conversions are between the same character sets. NetSurf has now been modified to cache the previous iconv conversion descriptor. This should fix the issue you are seeing \\(with the side effect that conversion is up to 18 times faster\\).",

The workaround is to replace the hard-space with %a0 in the URL.\r\nThe other issue \\(of running an application whose \\!Run file is typed to HTML\\) is so unlikely to occur in the real world that I'm not inclined to fix it. If you wish to bundle HTML files in an application such that the file is opened in a browser when run, I advise doing what NetSurf's full save functionality does and make the \\!Run file an obey file containing the single line \"Filer\\_Run &lt;Obey$Dir&gt;.foo/html\"",

If there is one,\r\nthat is used. If there is no cached copy, then the URL is\r\nrefetched.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there is a cached copy but it appears stale,\r\nthe cached content is revalidated. This will always happen\r\nfor local objects as the age limit is always 0. In general,\r\nrevalidation attempts to take account of two things:\r\n\r\n1\\) If the object has been modified since it was last fetched\r\n\\(by consulting the modification time of the object\\)\r\n2\\) If the object's content has changed but not the\r\nmodification date.\r\n\r\nIf it detects that the object has been changed since it was\r\ncached, then the object is refetched. Otherwise, the cached\r\ncopy is used. In this way, we can ensure that the viewed\r\ncontent is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nIn the case of local files, the second test is not currently\r\nused \\(and my suggestion of faking the HTTP ETag header for\r\nlocal files will fix this\\).\r\n\r\nThe local CSS files can be found in \\!NetSurf.Resources.",

I agree you don't want to load them every time if they're in RAM, though it's only 14k.

Even if NetSurf is not at fault, it would be nicer if the total size and percentage received were replaced by \"?\" when the no. of bytes received exceeds the supposed file size; e.g. \"Received 21.87 kB of ?\".\r\nI attach a screenshot showing the phenomenon.",

So according to the spec, if a server wants a client to display tags as text, it should replace the appropriate characters with html entities.\r\n\r\nOnce the page has been parsed into the XML tree we have no way of directly accessing the source text, so can't display the unprocessed form. We could probably rework the parsing to support this, but it would probably require a fair amount of work. The only time I can think of when you'd have raw HTML tags in a textarea is when you're editing something that contains HTML tags, so the text-&gt;XML-&gt;text conversion process shouldn't cause any serious problems.",

It is not site specific-  I have found BBC CNN are similarly affected SIC\\).\r\n\r\nI still get the Error report Failed to load body on the bottom left progress announciator. If I repeatedly hit the refresh button  eventually all the images are loaded and the error message stops - as expected .\r\n\r\nAs before this happens on my 5.11 Iyonix using a large Next slot of 9600K and my RPC 600SA   Adjust 4.39. \r\n\r\nIf I revert to the 10th March  Version the images are loaded OK on both machines. The machines are connected to a D Link 604T 4port LAN wireless router  -   notional download speed 1500kbps..... but reality on both machines is a max of 70kB/s.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember changing or loading anything new on the machines on or about the 10th March. The only program I run from boot on the Iyo  is P Vigays utility NeXtbar which then starts or sees a list of programs - which you can have if you think it will help solve why only my machines seems to be afflicted\\!\\! Module wise, I have the one to affect the DA limit if I run PhotoDesk.\r\n\r\nBoth Firefox B4/B5 on the Iyo download images from ABC etc. and Fresco on the RPC - but O2 also has this image loading problem -  with that I cannot revert to an earlier version which does work.\r\n",

If you cut and paste from an html file or URI/URL, or drag and drop the file then Netsurf treats it as a new page and runs it. If the source was a text file then it goes into the form field as intended. The workaround is to set the file type to text, or to paste the URL into a text file in \\!Edit and then copy it out again, but note that a new \\!Edit window won't work unless you type some text first to establish the file type.\r\n\r\nNetsurf has to distinguish between dropping html into a form field, and dropping it elsewhere in a browser window.",

  "description": "Since I started experimenting with different desktop themes \\(e.g. http://jymbob.drobe.co.uk\\) I have become more aware of which icons have their own palette, because they do not blend in with their surroundings like those that use the desktop palette.\r\n\r\nThe toolbar icons in the default Netsurf theme 'Aletheia' seem to fall into this category; I'm currently using a green-tinged desktop palette but the toolbar icons remain resolutely light grey. I think it would make more sense for them to use the desktop palette.",

This is becase the window tile sprite isn't a uniform colour and doesn't quite match colour 1 in the Wimp palette.

When I get this error and check the Task Window I have found as many as 8 Netsurf dynamic areas of varying size.\r\nMemory is released by quiting the app.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't appear to be related to opening multiple windows.

  "description": "I would like to be able to use the latest builds of NetSurf to access my Google mail account. This is a popular web-based e-mail service which has an optional 'plain HTML' interface which is ideally suited to NetSurf if one can overcome the obstacle of logging in.\r\n\r\nI am currently unable to log in to my account using test build 13 Jul 2006 23:00. The sequence of events is as follows:\r\n\r\nI enter the URL http://mail.google.com in one of NetSurf's URL input fields. This redirects momentarily to http://mail.google.com/mail/ and then to a  log-in page with the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail&passive=true&rm=false&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F%3Fui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&ltmpl=googlemail&ltmplcache=2\r\n\r\nEntering my user name and password takes me momentarily to:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/accounts/CheckCookie?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F%3Fui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&service=mail&chtml=LoginDoneHtml\r\n\r\nWhich redirects to the following \\(broken-looking\\) URL:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/accounts/'http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=html&zy=l'\r\n\r\nThis page displays the error message 'The page you requested is invalid'. It does not seem to make a difference whether or not I enabled the 'Remember me on this computer' option on the log-in page.\r\n\r\nHowever I can, with some difficulty, access Google mail using a test build dating from 24 Feb 2006 20:45 \\(which I keep specifically for this purpose\\).\r\n\r\nInitially, logging in leads me to a broken URL with the same error message \\(\"The page you requested is invalid\"\\) as the latest test build:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/accounts/'http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=html&zy=l&auth=QDNNNTjNNNO1b7CM8KBVM1n-WosjpSCloMhd\\_UKvPFPWfNLh1sPJFisleINaJ23NZvYu1gh6uADugnGx0uncCuZiatEPCpoVVOjCKxwPTXNf\\_OR6pdQCJXxpwqkkV\\_\\_O-AeiFy2iJY4Ag4VUf7dNQUvuK-hNY6f5'\r\n\r\n\\(I have scrambled the final part of this URL - after \"&auth=\" - to\r\navoid compromising my account's security.\\)\r\n\r\nDespite the error message, returning to http://mail.google.com/mail/ allows me to access my account \\(with the February test build\\). Instead of the usual invitation to log-in, a page is displayed giving the options of a JavaScript interface \\('standard view'\\), a non-JS interface \\('basic HTML view'\\) and a version for mobile phones. Selecting 'basic HTML view' displays my e-mail inbox correctly.\r\n\r\nThe URL for the interface selection page resembles the following \\(again, I have scrambled the 'auth' code\\):\r\n\r\nhttp://mail.google.com/mail/?auth=DQANNTfNNNNwzbBGpxjzAAajcdR7W76cqTv5rOCX9-FfMi0M0g-5HCT4l6wV4rz-leCnndzDzGIC8F\\_N9nejkUt2bvuqYXAbDuFrQMNEJIUGsJngNv9d89A6FZ6EXDtOzXWSm-3TVgRcuD510Yobe6jTuLixcr0n&mk=emy0j78zctf6\r\n\r\nWith the old version of NetSurf, even an apparently unsucessful log-in\r\ngenerates several additional Google cookies \\(whether or not I tick 'Remember me on this computer'\\). It is presumably one \\(or more\\) of these which enables access to my account.\r\n\r\nI believe the problem relates to cookie handling, but the recent improvements in this area do not seem to have resolved it. It was obviously the  intention of the site's designers that it should work with non-JavaScript browsers, so I am hopeful that NetSurf can do it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time.\r\n",

Things get worse when you have more than one line. Ctrl-V pastes what's on the clipboard but one line above the cursor, and then adds an extra newline.\r\nRepositioning the cursor can lead to random bits of text being highlighted - I'll upload a screen shot separately as SF gave me an error the first time and trashed everything I'd typed in.

That's how it was designed, so if you'd rather have it delete the line you could open a feature request for it. Once text selection is working properly I don't think there'll be much use for it.\r\n\r\nI'll probably be looking at the text selection next, but fixing it could take some time :\\(",

This situation is aggravated because Reset buttons don't work. I haven't raised a bug report for that one.\r\nCtrl-Z seems to be working with properly selected text \\(right now dragging the pointer is selecting text on several consecutive lines and merging all the fragments into one line\\).

  "description": "Visiting the frontpage of http://www.standaard.be/ means loading about 150 objects and most of them load very quickly.  However the last object takes a long time and during that period NetSurf memory usage grows steadily to about 22 MByte while communication with the server goes on.\r\n\r\nI suspect this memory usage is unnecessary and might show a memory leak in the redirection code : in the attached log file you see that the last object to be loaded is njs.gif which constantly gets refered to another URL by a 303 Object Moved server responce, each time adding to the URL the \"&dcsredirect=1\" string.  This happens about 292 times and then its stops \\(not sure why\\).  But in the meanwhile I guess about 15 MByte of RAM is wasted.\r\n\r\nSo several questions:\r\n\\- Is NetSurf behaving correctly in the sense that the server constantly replies with 303 Object Moved ? I guess this is a server/website configuration stupidity, right ?\r\n\\- Shouldn't there be a sensible bound to the number of URL redirections ? Or is there one but not yet met ? Or is the 292 one ?\r\n\\- Probably the most important question : am I right suspecting there is a memory leak in the redirection code ?\r\n",

  "description": "When attempting to render/display a local file of about 300k, Netsurf \\(15 Aug build\\) crashed - after some long time.\r\n\r\nIt reported that the document was complete \\(though nothing was displayed\\) after 8.5 seconds or so and then, almost immediately, the red/yellow hourglass appeared. After a further minute Netsurf closed the logfile after giving a trace and register dump.\r\n\r\nEarly on in the rendering process a warning indicated that box-&gt;last was wrong. The entire document seemed to have been rendered before a whole  lot of additional stuff was written to the log - apparently some configuration information and finally many lines relating to fonts and font names.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the log file is 17Mb raw \\(about a third of a Mb as a zip file\\) - which sourceforge complained about - incompletely - as an error.\r\n\r\nI have a zip file containing the original local file and the log if you wish me to forward it direct to someone.\r\n\r\nKeith Hopper\r\nasgard@inspire.net.nz\r\n\r\nPS Sorry that this is the third error report this am - but I have the odd feeling that this one might be related to the first one.",

  "description": "\\*\\*Original Post to Mail list \\[amended\\] as follows since your response\\*\\* \r\n\r\nSince the upgrade of NetSurf \\[around the end of May \\(delete previous ref to Style Sheets\\)\\] \r\nI have been unable to complete any financial transactions via https web pages.\r\n\r\n\\[ Normal HTTPS usage for sign-up to mail lists, register with SourceForge etc.is perfect\\! \\]\r\n\r\nThis first showed with PayPal, which I was not too bothered about as I \r\nonly rarely use it, and after the kerfuffle with their new T&C \r\nacknowlegement, I am even less so.\r\n\r\nHowever, this week I needed to upgrade my details with ISP \r\n'Free-online.Net' \\( branch of PlusNet\\)\r\nand find it impossible to log into the secure section. My last \\[sucessful\\] access \r\nwas in January.\r\n\r\nThe open pages of this site load quickly and fully with no problems - \r\n\r\n\\- I am on Dial-Up -\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I go to the secure pages everything slows to a crawl. \r\nLots of errors occur such as 'errror loading object', 'SSL timedout' \r\nand 'failed after 30xxx millisec'\r\n\r\nDuring all this Style sheets are loading and then the message \r\n'Converting xxx bytes' appears for what appears to be up to 40 odd \r\nseconds at a time.\r\n\r\nFinally 'loading xx objects' takes for ever then 'processing page' \r\nstarts.\r\n\r\nA few seconds after this NetSurf disappears from the Icon bar with a \r\ncontinuous Hour Glass.\r\n\r\nPayPal behaviour is similar.\r\n\r\nInspection of the Log shows 'Termination signal received: Broken pipe' \r\nas the final entry\r\n\r\nThroughout the log there are many listings of the ISP's secure \r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\n\\[ copy of log 'nslog/zip' attached - Ns version 0804\\]\r\n\r\nTried again today with version 0819 and got a new error, never seen before,\r\na window saying 'netsurf failed to verify SSL certificate'\r\nand listing three certificate names.\r\n\r\nbest regards - Bryn Evans\r\n",

Scaling the page via the toolbar results in the frameset page being scaled \\(invisible to the user.\\) When refreshing the child frames are then propogated with the scale of the parent and thus it appears to work.\r\nAlthough the fix is relatively simple, I'm hesitant to introduce it until a new menu structure and supporting UI is introduced such that an established way of what actions affect which windows is done.\r\nA further issue is whether we should scale the actual frame sizes or just the content.

  "description": "At http://dictionary.reference.com , the 'Dictionary.com' logo in the top left corner of the page seems to invisibly overlap the adjacent text entry box. This manifests as the mouse pointer shape changing to a finger rather than a caret whilst over the left end of the text box. Clicking in this side of the box text follows the link instead of positioning the caret.\r\n\r\nThe overlap is increased if the width of the window is reduced or the display scale is increased \\(until eventually the 'Dictionary.com' graphic also visually overlaps the text box\\).\r\n\r\nA weird side effect is that pasting text from the clipboard into the text box will fail if the caret is within the area overlapped \\(i.e. the first few characters of text\\). Instead of entering the text into the field, it is displayed as a new page.\r\n\r\nThis is with the NetSurf test build of 01 Oct 2006 18:15, on RISC OS Select.",

  "description": "The 05 Nov 2006 20:00 test build of NetSurf just crashed, leaving a log file in which the last message is \"Termination signal received: Broken pipe\". The symptoms are very similar to bug \\#1519138, which has been closed. At the time I was browsing my Google mail inbox, and I believe that I had just clicked on a link to view an e-mail. I was browsing the BBC News web site at the same time.\r\n\r\nNetSurf often crashes when I am using Google mail, but usually it just leaves a truncated log with no error message, register dump, or stack backtrace. It is unusual for it to record a coherent error message. I will attach the log file \\(zipped\\).\r\n\r\nIt is not so much the error that is irritating \\(perhaps it is legitimate\\), but the fact that it is fatal and NetSurf does not report it properly.",

  "description": "I have sometimes noticed that Netsurf displays incorrect images when pages are loaded. Today I found one on the BBC news site. I have a screen grab and a full-save of the page affected. A picture of some damaged buildings was somehow mixed up with the blue Netsurf logo from the file:///&lt;Netsurf$Dir&gt;/Docs/intro\\_en page \\(which is the page my version displays when first opened.\\)\r\n\r\nWhen I went through the save directory to see if the image was there, it wasn't; the correct image had been saved. Furthermore the web page \\*partly\\* updated to use the correct image from the cache. \\(I dragged a window over part of the affected image, provoking a partial redraw.\\) However, I have a screen grab of the mixed-up image. Note that the corrupt image as shown in the screen grab is robust and continues to survive having windows dragged over it.\r\n\r\nI think I provoked this problem by loading a large number of pages in quick succession, but the problem isn't reliably repeatable.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.simon-smith.org/netsurf.zip shortly - I am compiling Netsurf log, web page, screen grabs, list of sites visited etc. for you to look at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It's a bit hacky though, and I'm not sure I like the fix.\r\n\r\nSummary of the issue:\r\n\r\nThe page in question includes itself \\(probably indirectly through a CSS file\\) as a CSS document. NetSurf detects that the content type is not permissible in the relevant context and thus ignores the \"stylesheet\". It does this by simply having the owning content remove itself from the user list of the bad one; leaving the bad content alone for content\\_clean\\(\\) to have its way with next time it's called. In the meantime, however, the bad content is still being fetched, parsed, etc. As it's the same document, we get some nice recursion going on, which eats memory until there is no more.\r\n\r\nSummary of the current workaround:\r\n\r\nAs the content's in error, once the parent has removed itself from the user list, it explicitly checks to see if there are no further registered users of the content. If there are none, then it forcibly stops the fetch and marks the bad content as being in error. I'm not 100% sure this catches all cases, however, and it certainly doesn't solve the generic issue of indirected self-reference \\(there are already checks all over the place for direct self-reference, as this is easy to do and fairly common\\). \r\n\r\nPerhaps a more robust solution would be to do the following:\r\n\r\nIn fetchcache\\(\\), traverse the parent content list up to the root. If the URL for the fetch being attempted is encountered, don't bother to fetch at all. This traversal needs to cover all registered users of the immediate parent content.\r\nUnfortunately, this doesn't cater for the case where the server serves up the same document from differing URLs \\(e.g. when different GET parameters are specified\\). Quite how we're meant to deal with that, I've no idea at present.",

In particular, use Ctrl-End to delete to the end of the current line. The selected area shrinks from the end as you delete text in the middle, one character for one. So if you had 100 characters selected, and deleted 25, you would end up with /50/ characters selected, not 75. Expected behaviour returns once the cursor is at or past the end of the selected block.\r\n\r\nOn this sourceforge text box, selecting 'goes funny' as well. Dragging and selecting once, I have now got several non-contiguous areas of highlighted text. This may be a line-wrap issue.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of sample screen grabs.

Generally the document being loaded was large - although I did find it happen witha smallish one - once.\r\n\r\nI say that the abort occurred at various stages because on the state pane at the window bottom various messages appeared - the one appearing most often being something like \"3/345 bad object ..\" but others gave \"fatal error\" only - before the error window requesting this report appeared.\r\n\r\nInterestingly also, merely a single 'click' to dismiss the window did not result in any action - a second click was necessary - resulting in the log file attached.\r\n\r\nWhile this error does crop up with LinkSure documents I have not had it occur with any other URL, so thought to attach the source if that might help in diagnosis.\r\n\r\nWhatever the message which appeared at the bottom of the window every log file had exactly the same callback list at the end.\r\n\r\nOver to you\\!\r\n\r\nKeith Hopper\r\nasgard@inspire.net.nz",

It's easy to tell the difference, because during the normal 'primary' download you can resize the Netsurf window; after it starts doing the extra stuff, the window stops responding.",

Browsing subsequent galleries it starts to go wrong.\r\n\r\nTwo things happen.\r\n1\\) the thumbnail image\\(s\\) do\\(es\\) not correspond with the image itself. The image\\(s\\) come\\(s\\) from previous galleries. Sometimes the odd one is replaced, in other instances the all thumbnails are replaced.\r\n2\\) This happens with the 'wrong' or correct thumbnails. The thumnail get a corrupted stripe along one edge. See attachment. F12 then enter enter forcing a refresh clears the problem. \r\n\r\nThis is on an Iyonix RO5.13 running Geminus \\(older graphics cards\\) and the test build of Netsurf available from 8/7/07 but also a problem all 1.x versions I have used.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to happen with O2 or Firefox on the same machine. \r\n\r\nThe attached file shows the problem, most of the thumbnails are from the first gallery I opened. \r\nRegards\r\nStan\r\n\r\n",

Additionally a line appears under the sourceforge logo at &lt;http://boxstar.sourceforge.net/&gt; but I think this may be a slightly different problem because it disappears if you scroll it off screen and back on, and partially disappears if you drag other windows over it etc. The other underlines are persistent.",

  "description": "From: Christopher Martin &lt;belles@internode.on.net&gt;\r\n\r\nI am using version 2.0 \\(Dev\\) \\(20 Aug 2007 02:45\\) r3529. But as I recall, this has been a long-standing bug. According to the User Guide, a Shift+Adjust click on a link should allow saving the target address as a URL. However, the behaviour is the same as that produced by plain Adjust, as if the Shift key status is being ignored.\r\n\r\nTonight, I downloaded the latest sources via SVN. I think I may have identified the cause of the problem. There is a block of code in function browser\\_window\\_mouse\\_action\\_html\\(...\\), in file &lt;netsurf.desktop.c.browser&gt;, in which three if-else tests are performed. The order of the tests is significant. The present order is as follows:\r\n\r\nif \\(mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_1 && mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_MOD\\_1\\) \\{  ... \\} else if \\(mouse & \\(BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_1 | BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_2\\)\\) \\{  ... \\} else if \\(mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_2 && mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_MOD\\_1\\) \\{  ... \\}\r\n\r\nMight I suggest you consider swapping the 2nd and 3rd tests so that the structure becomes:\r\n\r\nif \\(mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_1 && mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_MOD\\_1\\) \\{  ... \\} else if \\(mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_2 && mouse & BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_MOD\\_1\\) \\{  ... \\} else if \\(mouse & \\(BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_1 | BROWSER\\_MOUSE\\_CLICK\\_2\\)\\) \\{  ... \\}\r\n\r\nI have attached a modified version of &lt;netsurf.desktop.c.browser&gt; for your consideration. \\(I should mention that I do not yet have all the tools needed to build Netsurf for myself and test my changes.\\)",

  "description": "Using RO 5.11 on Iyonix. Latest version of Netsurf \\(downloaded today - 5 Nov 07\\). Don't know version number as it won't run\\!\nLoading Netsurf gives a 'scanning fonts' box, and egg timer. When it gets to 74% and shows a particular font in the box, it hangs the machine, requiring a power-down. The pointer also freezes and can't be moved by the mouse. I would be fairly sure this is because of a faulty font in my \\!fonts file. That's because it only started happening after installing this font, and that's where it seems to freeze.\nThe font is one downloaded from a PDF file using RiScript, and moved into my \\!Fonts directory by me quite recently. It is an incomplete font, but I need it for certain documents produced in Ovation and Artworks. The font loads, displays and prints perfectly from those applications so I am reluctant to remove it. Netsurf, however, objects to it\\!\nErrant font file attached. Is there anything that might be done to let NetSurf ignore whatever problem it finds with this font, and continue to load?\n\nthanks, Jeremy.\njeremy@brayshaw.org.uk",

  "description": "Cut-and-paste from a NetSurf window into the URL bar adds one extra spurious character to the end of whatever you paste. If what you pasted was a filename, the presence of the extra character is likely to cause a file not found response from the remote server.\r\n\r\nTo replicate this minor issue:\r\n\r\nOpen a page with an external link on it \\(e.g. of the form &lt;a href=\"http://www.example.com/index.html\"&gt;. View source. Drag-select the link text for the link. \\(i.e. Just the bit inside the double quotes.\\) Save the selection from the editor window onto the Netsurf iconbar  icon. A new NetSurf window will open, with a file:/// URL pointing to a ScrapFile, containing the pasted URL.\r\n\r\nIn the new NetSurf window, drag-select exactly the text of the link and drop it into the URL entry box. While the page is loading, click the mouse to the right of the pasted URL. You will see that there is a spurious character there. A hard space? A null? Hard to tell. If the link was to a web directory-level link \\(link ending in /\\) the page should still load. If the link is of the form http://www.example.com/index.html or http://www.example.com/image.png the link will probably not work because the extra spurious character is treated as part of the filename. You have to delete the extra character and retry. Seems to occur any time you cut and paste from within a NetSurf window into the URL field.",

If you then look at the style sheet \\(normal.css\\) you will see that the red cells \\(class charindex\\_simpable\\) have a td rule which contains font-size 24px, the blue ones have a td rule which contains NO font size while the black ones have a 4px font size.\r\n\r\nBelow this set of three rules is another set indicating the style to be applied to a elements which follow the td ones - each of these is given an identical font size of 24px - the size which Netsurf should, therefore, use\\!\r\n\r\nSomehow every version of Netsurf since last July gets the ideograph positioning wrong.

Loading NetSurf, after a clean boot, reduces this to 104MB free.\r\n\r\nThe PNG is an enlarged map, linked to from a smaller version, in a Gutenberg etext. After displaying the etext, about 75MB RAM is free, and it is then that clicking the link, to display the larger map, fails.\r\n\r\nHowever, I now find that if the PNG is dropped into NetSurf, \\_before\\_ displaying the etext \\(ie when 104MB RAM is free\\) then the PNG \\_does\\_ display without error. I am surprised that so much RAM is needed.\r\n\r\nSo your implied guess - too little memory - is correct, and this is not primarily a NetSurf problem.

The test builds that we sent you found no software bugs. I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do to solve this, and more reports or log files are not going to change that.\r\n\r\nTherefore we're going to close this and the other similar bugs. We request that you don't report more crashes until you replace your hardware.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n",

Copying films from one 'category' \\(list of film\r\nentries\\) to another no longer works, and nor do attempts to create new\r\ncategories. Both worked the last time I tried them \\(on earlier versions\r\nof NetSurf\\) and still work with WebsterXL with JavaScript disabled - so\r\nit can't be a case of newly-introduced JavaScript dependency...\r\n\r\nThis behaviour can be demonstrated on a sample account: go to\r\nhttp://imdb.com and log in as user 'Cunarder', password 'websterxl',\r\nthen select \"Cunarder's account\" from the various options at the top of\r\nthe page.   Click on 'Update MyMovies' \\(in centre column\\) and you should\r\nsee a list of 8 titles under the heading \"Cunarder's Movies\".\r\n\r\nSelect an appropriate title by clicking on the option icon to its left,\r\nselect the empty category 'Depp' from the menu icon at the bottom of the\r\nlist, and attempt to copy the title into that category by clicking the\r\n'Copy' button.\r\n\r\nWhat \\*should\\* happen is that the page reopens to display the new\r\ncontents of the destination category;  what actually happens on Netsurf\r\nis that the page reopens on the same list, and the title is not copied\r\nto the destination category at all \\(as can be established by clicking on\r\nthe 'Depp' entry listed on the left of the page\\).\r\n",

Neither of these properties are currently implemented in the layout engine. The opacity property is CSS3, which we've not started on. The z-index property is just not done yet and I'm not sure if it will be done with the existing layout engine, as it requires quite a lot of changes.

Actually it is waiting for input on the command line, hitting return in the shell used to launch NetSurf after trying the following example causes it to continue.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\nTry any valid telnet: address in the address bar, or click on a telnet: link, eg telnet://www.netsurf-browser.org:80\r\n\r\nThe CURL fetcher is registering the telnet: address scheme but probably shouldn't be, as NetSurf as NetSurf has no way of allowing the user to interact with the telnet session, and on proper telnet connections even typing things into the shell doesn't appear to put NetSurf back into a state where it can be used.\r\n",

This problem does not depend on the page being viewed at the time, it is something to do with the RISC OS interface. It is intermittent- sometimes doesn't happen in a session, but once it has started happening it will continue every time. Using release 2.5 on RISC OS 5.16 with Iyonix. Have tried using both the ROOL and the ROL toolbox modules in case the save as module was the cause- no difference found. Problem has been there for around a year with previous versions. I reported as tracker ID 2812696 but have now gained a Sourceforge account and uploaded a log file. I have to actually complete a save; if I just bring up the save as icon but then don't do it, it won't crash. If I drag the icon to a dir where the target exists and it asks if I want to replace it, if I say no it won't crash next time. if I say yes and the save completes it will crash next time.",

What happens is that during building the page, you can see the text in a white box, but after fully loading, the text disappears completely. So it seems that the text \\(and gfx\\) are overwritten by the yellow bar. You can however log-in, you can see the mousepointer changing ;\\) Hope this bug can be fixed.

The main difference with recent versions is that I'm now getting messages that Netsurf is running out of memory almost as soon as I look at the site:  I'm not sure if this is a genuine warning or a bug, as memory consumption doesn't seem very high when I check and the program seems to continue functioning nonetheless, whereas in the past this error has tended to effectively terminate browsing from that point on.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a log of a crash from version r10912 of 27 Oct 2010, in which I simply accessed one page on the Burda site from my hotlist and then clicked on a link before the program crashed - I dare say the problem is still cookie-related as I had forgotten to delete all site cookies before attempting to view it....",

NetSurf 2.1 interprets the content-type correctly under the above conditions.\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mw-software.com/test/\r\nUser: test\r\nPassword: testtest\r\n\r\nClick on the download link. The zip file is incorrectly interpreted as HTML and displayed in the browser window despite the server sending \"content-type: application/zip\". Other browsers interpret the content-type correctly, including earlier versions of NetSurf.\r\n\r\nNow, try again but Shift-click on the download link. This time, the file is correctly downloaded as a zip file. Now, try again with a normal click on the download link. Now even that works correctly. So, at a guess, this problem does not occur if the file is already in the cache.\r\n\r\nIf the resource in question is a large zip file, trying to interpret it as HTML can have nasty effects, causing NetSurf to apparently lock up the machine.",

Deleting it from its new position seems to work.\r\n\r\nDeleting several cookies, either via the same delete operation or individually, results in them all being moved to the bottom.

The test version I had used before that was r12243, which AFAICR did not exhibit this bug.\r\n\r\nThe browser keeps stiffing the computer totally - hourglass running, but nobody home.  I can't find a specific cause, but it often occurs when closing browser windows.  Since installing r12288 and subsequently r12380, almost every NetSurf session has eventually been terminated in this manner, by means of Alt+Break.\r\n\r\nOn this particular occasion, I closed the last browser window, revealing the hotlist beneath.  I clicked on the collapse button for the level which was currently open, and the the top level \\(its parent\\).  Neither level collapsed, which is when I discovered the computer had locked up.  I mention this in case it's relevant \\(by analogy to Windows stiffing if you click too fast\\).\r\n\r\nNo log file crash report, because the program didn't trap the crash.  I have attached the final section of the log file it did leave behind, starting from the point when I opened the fateful window.\r\n\r\nThis is, needless to say, an extremely serious bug.",

By some combination of key presses and mouse clicks it appears that the scroll bar begins to function but it doesn't always do what you expect. Sometimes its OK, but other times it scrolls the opposite way to the expected direction. This appears to be because the hand pointer is displayed and despite it being over the scroll bar, its being interpretted as over the document content.  Clicking in the space above/below the scroll bar doesn't always do what is expected either, but it does seem to change the behaviour so that sometimes scrolling works OK.  This is quite weird and tricky to give precise instructions to reproduce consistent symptoms.\r\nmike@mhobbs.demon.co.uk",

  "description": "\\[Iyonix RISC OS 5.16\\]\r\n\r\nThis was supposed to be a repeatable bug.  It still happens most of the time, but not all the time.\r\n\r\nThe first log is of me going to &lt;http://www.amigaremix.com&gt; and clicking on the first MP3 link \\(second column\\) on the current front page \\(\"Guitar Slinger\"\\), which is supposed to download the MP3.  In this case, it was at &lt;http://www.amigaremix.com/listen/2502/Zzr%20-%20Guitar%20Slinger%20remake%202011.mp3&gt;.  NetSurf segfaulted.  I successfully produced the same error on all attempts with r12624, r12633, r12664 and r12668.\r\n\r\nSo, after that I thought I'd get all smart and try to reduce it to a minimal test case.  The only unusual things I could see about the URL was that it was a binary file, and there were hex codes in its name, so I tried uploading a test binary file with hex codes in its name.  Much to my annoyance, NetSurf downloaded this perfectly.\r\n\r\nTrying to figure out exactly what had gone wrong, I went back to the original file via the AmigaRemix front page \\(so not a directly typed-in URL\\)... which then proceeded to download perfectly.\r\n\r\nIn desperation, I quit NetSurf the normal way and clicked on a saved copy of the MP3 link above, causing NetSurf to load automatically in the process.  The file again downloaded perfectly.\r\n\r\nThen, without quitting NetSurf, I went back to the AmigaRemix front page, where I had first observed the bug and which had worked on the last attempt.  I clicked the link and... whoops, it crashed.\r\n\r\nThe second log is of this last attempt, starting from the automatic load.\r\n\r\nI hope I've managed to provide enough information to make this bug fixable, and that I'm not the only person who can trigger it.  It seems easiest to crash from a 'cold start' - i.e. not having viewed any other pages first - but bear in mind that the very first crash was at the end of an extended browsing session.  Also, as far as I can tell, it's impossible to crash without having clicked the link on the AmigaRemix site - all 'Open URL' attempts and link clicks in other applications so far have worked.",

I have been experiencing this bug most days for the last couple of years, it still occurs with version 2.8, and not just when saving images but also when saving out web pages. It doesn't have to be from the same web page either. However it is intermittent, sometimes it works fine for a whole session. I have tried various things to see if it is related to the order I boot applications or modules, but have never managed to pin down the cause. Ewen Pring.",

  "description": "When scrolling up and down a page, NetSurf r12872 \\(RISC OS 5.16\\) frequently blanks out sections of the document which come into view, but then fails to redraw them.  The problem is intermittent and difficult to reproduce, but is very reminiscent of a similar redraw box-related scrolling bug which was fixed several months ago.\r\n\r\nI don't guarantee results, but one page which seems to be suffering particularly badly is http://www.corporateskull.com/.  Casually dragging the vertical scrollbar downwards will usually result in the loss of a horizontal chunk out of the top picture in the current most recent blog post, \"The end of Corporate Skull\".\r\n\r\nI've discovered a few other issues by accident while testing.  Clicking on a second NetSurf browser window which is behind the Corporate Skull one, keeping the Skull title bar visible, and then clicking the latter to bring the Skull window back to the front, will result in the entire formerly covered area of the Skull window being blank.  I tested this with the SourceForge 'Add Artifact' window I'm typing into, and I was unable to reverse the effect - i.e. to blank out the SourceForge window by opening, and then hiding, the Corporate Skull window in front of it.  I could, however, blank the Skull window by opening a StrongED window in front of it, although this took several attempts, suggesting either a very intermittent bug or one dependent on some uncontrolled third factor, e.g. dragging of NetSurf windows in the meantime. \r\n\r\nDragging any other window over a blanked area will cause the redraw to be completed in the regions the dragged window leaves behind.  This also works with menus, including opening a menu over the NetSurf window itself.",

  "description": "Material required for reproduction: Any multi-line text input box.  The ones on SourceForge will do just fine.\r\n\r\nWhen typing into a text box and its height changes above its original maximum extent \\(i.e. a scrollbar is present or newly created\\), whether this be by having typed too much, or simply having pressed Return repeatedly, then in between the keypress which caused the height to change and the next one, the caret is wrongly vertically positioned.  The same symptoms occur whether the height increases or decreases, but if it increases, the caret is below the correct position, and if it decreases, it is above.  It is reset to its correct position on the next keypress.  The exact amount of error seems to vary according to the total extent, or possibly even just randomly.\r\n\r\nThe error doesn't occur if there is no vertical scrollbar in the text box either before or after the height change \\(i.e. if the extent of the box is still the same, but some parts are off-limits to the caret\\).  It does occur if a scrollbar is created or deleted in the process.  The actual vertical position of the caret is immaterial - it doesn't necessarily have to be at the bottom.\r\n\r\nTested, reproduced and confirmed on NetSurf r12872 \\(RISC OS 5.16\\), repeatedly, in this very text box, not always voluntarily.",

  "description": "With RISC OS version 2.8 \\(2.7 did not show this problem\\). Go to Page entry of main menu, choose Find text, and then type a single character \\(which exists on the page being viewed\\) into the string box, the cursor jumps to the next occurrence of that character but the window vanishes. The main menu remains on view but with the Page entry greyed out. Therefore I cannot continue typing more than one letter, to search for a string. If the single typed character does NOT exist on the page, the window does not vanish, and it says Not Found at the bottom as expected. A work-around is to use the pop up history menu \\(of search strings\\). Once something has been selected from this list, the entry in the text box can be altered to add further characters until I've typed what I actually want to search for without the window disappearing.\r\nEwen Pring",

  "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nBeen trying to compile Netsurf \\(stable 2.8 and yesterday's latest r13109 from svn\\) for linux framebuffer frontend on an embedded Linux \\(3.0.4 kernel & quite basic Busybox\\) booting from PXE, running in a VMWare. Problem with both versions is that it almost immediately segfaults after launch, like this:\r\n\r\n\\[...\\]\r\n\\(0.18172\\) content/fetchers/curl.c fetch\\_curl\\_setup 359: fetch 0x8b9c738, url 'http://www.heise.de/'\r\n\\(0.18266\\) framebuffer/fbtk/fbtk.c fbtk\\_request\\_redraw 106: redrawing 0x8b9b630 0,0 640,26\r\n\\(0.18278\\) framebuffer/fbtk/fbtk.c do\\_redraw 563: clipping 0x8b9aff0 0,0 800,600\r\n\\(0.18286\\) framebuffer/fbtk/fbtk.c do\\_redraw 563: clipping 0x8b9b0b8 0,0 800,30\r\nSegmentation fault\r\n\r\nI've pasted some more useful output into a Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/b44dHYss - Contained in there is an \"fbset -i\" \\(just to show that the framebuffer is working - an ancient pre-compiled version 2.0 of Netsurf did in fact work nicely in that same environment\\), my Makefile.defaults \\(got rid of the references to Makefile.config\\), the entire \"netsurf -v -f linux\" Output and an abbreviated ltrace and strace of that same command.\r\n\r\nIt \\*appears\\* to be a problem in fbtk's do\\_redraw\\(\\) but I have no idea how to fix this or if it has something to do with my libs or whatever. The dependencies have been compiled with basic \"make install\" from svn on the dev-machine and only the libs which \"ldd netsurf\" told me have been copied to the target.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks already,\r\nAndy",

Further down the page \\(below the image\\), there is an invisible link to \"ofcom announces winners of the 4g auction\" - which is on Firefox is the second image on the banner - which prevents Ofcom for consumers, Ofcom licensing and part of Ofcom for stakeholders being clicked\r\n3\\. This repeats with the third invisible link \"how much does a phone call really cost\" on top of the majority of the links under the Ofcom for consumers and Ofcom licensing headings.  The alt text when hovering over these links is correct, the target is not.\r\n4\\. The fourth banner image section \"Ofcom awards Liverpool local tv licence\" is available as a hidden link on top of the cookies banner.\r\n\r\nThis page also seems to be decoding/displaying the images multiple times.

This resulted in no working translations at all which is\r\n   not the issue you describe.\r\n\r\n - Secondly there seems to be an issue where a libintl.so is\r\n   incorrectly linked to NetSurf. This provides gettext symbols and\r\n   the library is probably included via GTK (pure speculation).\r\n\r\n   NetSurf itself provides its own gettext interface symbols (in\r\n   gtk/gettext.c). On Linux Glibc builds this suffices for symbol\r\n   resolution and the linker users our internal i10n routines to\r\n   provide translated text. \r\n\r\n   On BSD this does not appear to happen so GTK is using the wrong\r\n   routines and failing to show the translated text. Someone who\r\n   understands the linker and symbol resolution on BSD systems needs\r\n   to look at this as I am currently not in a position to solve this\r\n   myself.",

  "description": "First I'd like to thank all the developers for such a great project. NS is a bucket of sanity in an ocean of madness.\r\n\r\nThere's something I noticed while using nsgtk 3.0. Page scrolling with the mouse scroll button as well as the keyboard up/down arrows is way too slow.\r\nReading long texts or rapidly browsing a page becomes very difficult and I have to scroll entire pages using page up/down.\r\n\r\nNote that scrolling works fine in all other applications, including GTK-based ones.\r\n\r\nThanks and keep up the great work!",
