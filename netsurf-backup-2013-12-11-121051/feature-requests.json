  "description": "When downloading files with encoded characters in their names \\(such as those at http://www.stairwaytohell.com/heartcore \\), the local file name proposed by Netsurf substitutes underscores for percent symbols in the original name. Presumably this is because '%' is not valid in a RISC OS file name. As a result I now have lots of files on my hard disc named things like 'heartcore\\_20-\\_20the\\_20game\\_20-\\_20128kbps\\_20-\\_2004' \\(which should be 'heartcore - the game - 128kbps - 04'\\).\r\n\r\nWhen proposing a local file name, please could NetSurf decode characters specified in hexadecimal, where these are printable? I assume that the subsequent translation of spaces \\(ASCII &20\\) into hard-spaces \\(character &A0\\) is a separate issue.",

Ctrl+U only deletes one line, and it seems impossible to either make a selection larger than the visible text with the mouse, ctrl+A often selects the entire page, and ctrl+X fails to delete.  \r\n\r\nAll that needs fixing, but a shortcut would be a workaround and a useful feature in itself.

  "description": "See mailing list discussion: http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-users-netsurf-browser.org/2011-February/009951.html\r\n\r\nAt present, the situation with toolbar editing is as follows:\r\n\r\nClicking Menu over a browser window toolbar and selecting 'Edit toolbar' allows you to add or remove buttons.  This change is immediate and permanent - it applies to that window, all windows opened \\(e.g. by target=\"\\_blank\"\\) from that window, and all windows opened independently in the future, including after quitting and restarting NetSurf.  It does not apply to other windows currently open, or their descendants.\r\n\r\nEditing a toolbar in any other window \\(e.g. hotlist, cookies\\) is also permanent \\(inlcuding across restarts\\), although in this case only one copy may be present at any time.\r\n\r\nAdding or removing gadgets from a browser window toolbar \\(buttons/address/throbber\\) is not permanent - it applies only to that window and its descendants, not any new windows.  For this to happen, the option 'Display-&gt;Save as default' from the main browser area menu must be used.\r\n\r\nAdding or removing gadgets from a non-browser toolbar \\(in this case just buttons\\) is permanent, as above, and these windows do not have a 'Save as default' menu option.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is inconsistent and needs changing to one or the other in both cases.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like the current less than obvious position of the 'Save as default' option, and would prefer that option to be removed and everything to be permanent.  As things stand, this would affect only adding and removing gadgets from the browser toolbar, and not necessitate the addition of a 'Save as default' option to all other windows.",

  "description": "I use AmigaOS 4.1 and NetSurf 2.7 Revision 11703\r\n\r\nI notice a strange bahaviour using NetSurf's tabs, if you open a new tab that isn't related to the previews one \\(for example opening a new \"blank\" tab and then typing an address manually\\) the left arrow in toolbar permit to turn back as the page in tab opened was \"linked\" to the first one\r\n\r\nI think that the normal behavoiur should be that each tab should have it's own history \\*only\\* rathen then share the history with the other tabs opened \\(the first tab in this case\\)\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n\r\n\\- Open NetSurf\r\nNow the first page is www.netsurf-browser.org/welcome \r\n\r\nNaturally in this first page the left and right arrows in toolbar are correctly ghosted\r\n\r\n\\- Then now open a new blank tab from WB menu or with the addtab button\r\nNow if you go in this second tab you can see the same default page \\(www.netsurf-browser.org/welcome\\) but with the left arrow active, so it seems that this new page is linked in certain term with the first tab, but it's not or would not \\!\r\n\r\nAbout this i receive a note from the AmigaOS4 mantainer:\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\nto create a tab you have to have a \"clone\"\r\nwindow \\(so the frontend knows where the tab needs to be created\\).  There's\r\nno way of telling the core that this is a completely new tab which needs\r\nnew history.  I'll have to check the gtk version, but I suspect that has\r\nthe same problem.\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n\r\nIs it possible to support such feature in the future release ?",

  "description": "CSS 3 introduced an overflow-y property. If NetSurf could support this then it would make it usable with, for example, Lloyds TSB business internet banking for me once again.\r\nMore info: at present when the Lloyds site gives a list \\(for example of account payees\\) the user can only see the top few entries and the rest is hidden with no way to see in the browser. The page is designed to show a vertical only scroll bar but Netsurf doesn't.\r\nThe reason for this is that the HTML \\(a simple example attached\\) for a limited size element \\(the list, eg 90 pixels high\\) uses the CSS 2 property overflow:hidden \\(thereby ensuring Netsurf shows no scroll bars when the content exceeds the area available\\) but also the CSS 3 property overflow-y:scroll \\(which is intended to put a scroll bar in vertically\\). Web develpers have started doing this because before CSS 3 if they used overflow:auto then browsers would put in both horizontal and vertical scrollbars, whereas they prefer vertical only scrollbars, which they can now get with CSS 3.\r\nEwen Pring",

Usually, I have to install my unique driver from Apple to get the ethernet to work.  Wow.  This is amazing.  Thank you to the producer for something fun to do on my days off.  I know it is Saturday and not Sunday yet.  However, I am taking my Sabbath day of Holy Rest early.  hehe",

  "description": "Great to see these text-edit boxes have become more reliable -- thanks, Michael.\nPity though, about the display of this Sourceforge page: the text here is so tiny, and the width so wide, that it is very comfortable for the eyes.\nWould it be simple to adjust the CSS of this page \\(or whatever\\)? There's an awful lot of wasted white space.\nSee attached screenshot from Netsurf \\#1002 on Iyonix 5.18.\n\nZooming the page helps somewhat, but lines are too wide for the screen by the time text height is reasonable. Plus there are queer redraw phenomena where some of the text seems to get lost.\n\nIn short, apologies for any typos here, but I can't read what I writ\\!",
